# AGENTS.md

This file defines the working contract for `/home/home/p/g/n/jido_integration`.

## Onboarding

Read `ONBOARDING.md` first for the repo's one-screen ownership, first command,
and proof path.

## Purpose

`jido_integration` is a tooling-root Elixir monorepo for the greenfield
integration platform. The repo root owns workspace tooling only. Runtime code
belongs in isolated child packages.

## Repository Shape

The current package layout is:

```text
jido_integration/
  lib/                  # monorepo Mix tasks and workspace helpers only
  test/                 # root tooling tests only
  docs/                 # repo-level docs only
  core/                 # platform/runtime packages
  connectors/           # connector packages, one package per connector
  apps/                 # thin app/reference packages above the public platform
```

Current core packages:

- `core/asm_runtime_bridge`
- `core/auth`
- `core/brain_ingress`
- `core/conformance`
- `core/consumer_surfaces`
- `core/contracts`
- `core/control_plane`
- `core/direct_runtime`
- `core/dispatch_runtime`
- `core/ingress`
- `core/inference_runtime`
- `core/model_invocation_contracts`
- `core/platform`
- `core/platform_cluster_runtime`
- `core/policy`
- `core/runtime_control`
- `core/runtime_router`
- `core/session_runtime`
- `core/store_local`
- `core/store_postgres`
- `core/webhook_router`

Current connector packages:

- `connectors/github`
- `connectors/linear`
- `connectors/notion`
- `connectors/codex_cli`
- `connectors/market_data`

Current app packages:

- `apps/devops_incident_response`
- `apps/inference_ops`

Archived proof packages kept off the default workspace/CI lane:

- `apps/trading_ops`

## Documentation Homes

Keep documentation aligned to the permanent V2 layout:

- repo-level architecture and operational guides belong in `docs/`
- package-specific workflows belong in package-local `README.md` files and
  package-local docs folders when needed
- host-level proof runbooks belong in `apps/*/README.md`
- proof code belongs in child packages or top-level apps, not in root
  `examples/` or `reference_apps/`

## Operating Rules

- Keep the repo root tooling-only. Do not move runtime or connector logic into
  the root unless it is genuinely monorepo-wide glue.
- Dependency source selection is handled by
  `build_support/dependency_sources.exs` and
  `build_support/dependency_sources.config.exs`. Local overrides use
  `.dependency_sources.local.exs`, which must stay gitignored. Dependency
  source selection must not use environment variables.
- Runtime application code under `lib/**` must not call direct OS env APIs.
  Runtime env reads belong in `config/runtime.exs` or a `Config.Provider`, then
  compiled/runtime code should consume materialized config or explicit options.
- This repo is a Weld consumer. Keep Weld checks focused on helper drift,
  dependency-source manifest validity, AGENTS guidance, generated package
  contracts, and publish order.
- Keep package boundaries explicit. If a connector uses a library directly, declare that dependency in the connector package instead of relying on transitive deps.
- Keep every child package's `deps/`, `_build/`, and `mix.lock` independent. Never
  commit links from a child build/dependency path into the workspace root or
  another package; parallel workspace tasks rely on those paths being isolated.
- Prefer adding new capabilities by adding or extending child packages, not by broadening the root project.
- Treat `contracts` as the shared public model and keep downstream packages honest against it.
- Treat `core/brain_ingress` as the durable brain-to-lower-gateway intake seam. Scope
  resolution, submission acceptance, and typed rejection normalization belong
  there rather than in the workspace root or connector packages.
- Treat `platform` as the public facade package. The root workspace must not
  reclaim app identity `:jido_integration_v2`.
- Treat shared adapter packages as contract producers, not governance owners.
  When implementing an adapter for `:inference`, Jido owns the governed
  translation into `InferenceRequest`, durable run/attempt truth, route
  selection, credential leases, replay, and review metadata. The adapter must
  not grow provider SDK branches or bypass `ControlPlane.Inference.invoke/2`.
- Treat connector packages as isolated deliverables. Each connector should compile, test, lint, type-check, and document cleanly on its own.
- `DependencyResolver.execution_plane/1` resolves local sibling development to
  `../execution_plane/core/execution_plane`. Do not point `:execution_plane` at
  the sibling repo root; that root is the non-published Blitz workspace project.
- Use the root `mix jido.integration.new` scaffold for new connector packages
  so they start with explicit child-package deps, runtime-fit handlers, and
  package-local conformance coverage.
- Keep webhook and async proof surfaces where they belong:
  - connector-local when the behavior is part of the connector contract
  - app-local when the behavior depends on hosted routing, dispatch handlers, or
    package composition above the connector
- Do not recreate the old root `examples/` or `reference_apps/` layout.

## Required Validation Workflow

The root monorepo commands are the canonical quality surface for this repo.

Fresh clone setup from the repo root:

```bash
test -x bin/mix
git check-ignore -v bin/mix && {
  echo "bin/mix is ignored; remove the broad external ignore before continuing"
  exit 1
}
mix deps.get
mix mr.deps.get
```

`bin/mix` is a repo-owned workspace wrapper, not a local-only artifact. Keep it
portable and tracked; do not replace it with a machine-specific shim path.

At minimum, future agents should preserve this invariant:

> The repo docs now match the tooling-root workspace slice. I’m finishing with
> the root `mix ci` pass so the package graph is validated under the same
> monorepo commands the repo is supposed to expose.

Run these from the repo root:

```bash
mix monorepo.format
mix monorepo.compile
mix monorepo.test
mix monorepo.credo --strict
mix monorepo.dialyzer
mix monorepo.docs
mix ci
```

`mix ci` is the main acceptance gate. If it fails, the repo is not done.
It is Blitz impact-aware through Hex `~> 0.3.0`: clean baselines write compact
`.blitz/` state, docs edits stay owner-local, and source or `mix.exs` edits cascade through reverse package deps.

For connector-facing slices, also run the root conformance task against every
affected connector module, for example:

```bash
mix jido.conformance Jido.Integration.V2.Connectors.GitHub
mix jido.conformance Jido.Integration.V2.Connectors.Linear
```

The root `mix.exs` also exposes equivalent `mr.*` shortcuts for day-to-day
use:

```bash
mix mr.deps.get
mix mr.format
mix mr.compile
mix mr.test
mix mr.credo --strict
mix mr.dialyzer
mix mr.docs
```

Package-local live proofs remain opt-in. They should never be required for the
default root acceptance gate.

## Live Provider Checks

For live provider checks, use `~/scripts/with_bash_secrets <command>`. It sources
`~/.bash/bash_secrets` and execs the command. Do not print secret values. Pipe
`LINEAR_API_KEY` via stdin for Linear examples. GitHub live examples use `gh auth`
or `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` from the wrapper. Codex SDK examples use the existing
Codex/OpenAI machine auth through the wrapper. Live provider smoke is not product
acceptance unless it runs the product-owned Extravaganza command path.

## Shared Adapter Boundary Checklist

Use this checklist when a shared library such as `:inference` enters Jido
through a Jido-owned adapter:

- Preserve `Inference.Client.defaults`, `Inference.Request.options`, request
  metadata, trace context, and session fields unless the Jido boundary has an
  explicit reason to reject them.
- Prove request-level options override client defaults where both are accepted.
- Map portable tool controls into Jido `tool_policy`; do not leave them as
  unstructured provider options.
- Preserve provider-reported usage, cost, finish reason, route, run id, and
  attempt id on the returned shared response.
- Keep internal compatibility options internal. Do not leak raw prompts,
  provider payloads, secrets, or workflow histories into public DTOs, docs, or
  receipts.
- Run the shared producer package gate when the adapter depends on new shared
  semantics, then run this repo's root `mix ci`.

## Working Style

- Make changes package-first, then validate from the root.
- When adding a new package, wire it into the root monorepo task surface so it is covered by the same commands as the rest of the repo.
- When changing connector review semantics, keep `core/conformance`, the root
  `mix jido.conformance` task, and connector companion evidence modules aligned.
- When adding a new connector package, prefer generating it from
  `mix jido.integration.new <connector_name>` and then editing the emitted
  package in place instead of hand-rolling a new child project.
- Keep README/package docs aligned with the current slice. Do not leave architecture or package docs behind the code.
- Keep repo guide text aligned with the actual package graph and proof surfaces.
- When documenting workflows, point to package-local or app-level proofs rather
  than inventing new root-level examples.
- Prefer TDD/RGR for new vertical slices: add or extend tests first, implement, then run the full root gate.
- Do not silently weaken quality gates to get green CI. Fix package boundaries or dependency shape instead.

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not rely on transitive dependencies between child packages.
- Do not let a connector or app depend on the repo root; keep dependencies
  minimal and explicit.
- Do not let a connector package depend on unrelated runtime packages “because
  it works”; keep dependencies minimal and explicit.
- Do not assume root Dialyzer coverage is enough. The monorepo tasks intentionally run quality checks inside each child package as well.
- Do not treat generated docs as proof of correctness unless `mix monorepo.docs` or `mix docs.all` passes cleanly.
- Do not let V1-only layout language drift back into repo docs or package docs.

## Expected Next Steps

The current skeleton proves four runtime families:

- direct
- session
- stream
- inference

Natural future slices include:

- additional durable stores
- richer auth lifecycle
- composed policy/gateway rules
- live CLI-published inference endpoints
- additional self-hosted inference backends
- more connectors
- more operator/reference apps above the public platform

## Temporal developer environment

Temporal CLI is implicitly available on this workstation as `temporal` for local durable-workflow development. Do not make repo code silently depend on that implicit machine state; prefer explicit scripts, documented versions, and README-tracked ergonomics work.

## Native Temporal development substrate

When Temporal runtime behavior is required, use the stack substrate in `/home/home/p/g/n/mezzanine`:

```bash
just dev-up
just dev-status
just dev-logs
just temporal-ui
```

Do not invent raw `temporal server start-dev` commands for normal work. Do not reset local Temporal state unless the user explicitly approves `just temporal-reset-confirm`.
